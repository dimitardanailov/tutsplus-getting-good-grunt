## Course description

In both front-end and back-end projects, there are so many things to do besides the actual coding: there’s all the maintenance that a project requires: compilation, unit testing, linting, etc. You could do this manually, but you want to focus on the code, right? That’s why you’ll want to check out Grunt: it’s an automation tool that will do all that “boring” work for you! In this course, Andrew Burgess will teach you how to get up and running with Grunt, and make the most of its capabilities.
